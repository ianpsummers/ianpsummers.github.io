				<h1> The Oscars International Feature Nominees continue to expand, but Eastern Europe is still largely left untouched. </h1>

				<p>
					Europe has long been a hotbed for quality films as countries like Italy and France have produced some Western favorites dating back to the 40s and 50s.
				</p>
				<p>
					But even as some countries like Ireland (<i>The Quiet Girl</i> in 2022) and Romania (<i>Collective</i> in 2020) have received their first nominations in recent years, the Academy has yet to recognize a number of Eastern European countries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Latvia, Belarus, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Turkey are all among the countries that have never been nominated for the International Feature award. All five of these countries, coincidentally, border either Russia or the Black Sea.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course, some continents such as Africa and Oceania have long been disregarded by the Academy in comparison to Europe, but the contrast <i>within</i> Europe is what makes it unique when compared to the rest of the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					France, Italy, Germany and Spain all have 20 or more nominations over the course of the 76 years that Best International Feature has been included at the Academy Awards. Given that each country is only allowed to have one entry per year, and there are only five nominations total, it's clear that these four countries hold a monopoly over this category.
				</p>
				<p>
					This data was gathered from Kaggle and the dataset included all information on the award since it's inception. The European data was the most striking however due to that continent having the most congestion and most other continents around the world not being consistently recognized and represented during awards season.
